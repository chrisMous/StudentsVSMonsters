Text Based Battle Arena Tower Conquest Game

Students with various specialities from Computer Science battle Monsters.
The goal of the game is to reach the top of the Arena Battle Tower by clearing waves of Monsters.

The members of the Monster team are parsed from a text file and each line of the file corresponds to
a wave of monsters that can be found in each floor that needs to be cleared. The game difficulty can vary by modifying this file and adding higher or lower leveled opponents. 

Students use programmed strategic tactics to perform each of their moves depending on the circumstances of the battle. Moves include basic attacks and spells, unique special attacks and in some cases healing spells.
